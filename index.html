        <h2>The theory of relativity</h2>
        <div class="content">
            Albert Einstein conceived and published two connected physics theories, special relativity and general relativity, in 1905 and 1915, respectively. 
            Special relativity governs all physical processes in the absence of gravity. 
            General relativity describes the law of gravitation and how it relates to natural forces. 
            It applies to cosmology and astrophysics, especially astronomy.
            The idea altered theoretical physics and astronomy in the twentieth century, displacing a 200-year-old mechanics theory developed principally by Isaac Newton. 
            It introduced notions such as 4-dimensional spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, simultaneity relativity, gravitational and kinematic time dilation, and length contraction.
            In physics, relativity advanced the understanding of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions while also ushering in the nuclear age.
            Cosmology and astrophysics used relativity to anticipate remarkable astronomical phenomena like neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves.
