        <h2>The theory of relativity</h2>
        <div class="content">
            Albert Einstein conceived and published two connected physics theories, special relativity and general relativity, in 1905 and 1915, respectively. 
            Special relativity governs all physical processes in the absence of gravity. 
            General relativity describes the law of gravitation and how it relates to natural forces. 
            It applies to cosmology and astrophysics, especially astronomy.
            The idea altered theoretical physics and astronomy in the twentieth century, displacing a 200-year-old mechanics theory developed principally by Isaac Newton. 
            It introduced notions such as 4-dimensional spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, simultaneity relativity, gravitational and kinematic time dilation, and length contraction.
            In physics, relativity advanced the understanding of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions while also ushering in the nuclear age.
            Cosmology and astrophysics used relativity to anticipate remarkable astronomical phenomena like neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves.

            Prior to Einstein's groundbreaking work, the laws of motion put forth by Isaac Newton in 1686 laid down the foundation for astronomers' comprehension of the universe. These three well-accepted principles include:

            The inertia principle, explaining that an object at rest or in motion will continue in that state unless impacted by an external force.
            Newton's second law states that the force on an object is determined by multiplying its mass by its acceleration, paving the way to determine the force required to change the speed movement of objects of varying mass.
            <br>
            His third law simply explains that there is an equal and opposite reaction for all actions.
            According to Encyclopedia Britannica, except for a few exceptions, these foundational principles of physics - Newton's laws, were capable of explaining most phenomena and formed the basis of our understanding of mechanics and gravity.
            Nonetheless, Newton's laws fell short of explaining certain phenomena, notably, the behavior of light.
            To fit the peculiar behavior of light within Newton's framework of physics, 19th-century scientists hypothesized that a medium named "luminiferous ether" transmitted light. This hypothetical medium needed to possess enough rigidity to convey light waves, akin to how a guitar string transports sound while remaining entirely unobservable in the movements of celestial bodies, such as planets and stars.
